# Writing a C compiler

A Rust implementation of the book [Writing a C Compiler](https://norasandler.com/book/) by Nora Sandler

This is currently a work in progress. I have implemented up to chapter 13 including all extra-credit
until there.

It currently only works on macOS with ARM64 cpus (but generating x86 code). Linux support will come in the future.
